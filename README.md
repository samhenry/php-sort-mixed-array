Given a mixed array of numbers and alphanumeric terms, please implement a function \ method that will return a sorted array such that the numbers are in numeric order, and the alphanumeric terms are in alphabetical order subject to the following constraints:

	For any index n in the array, the type of value at index n must be the same in the input and result arrays – e.g., given the input array { 12, beta, 10, alpha } the positions (0, 2) are numeric, while the positions (1, 3) are alphanumeric, so the sorted result should be { 10, alpha, 12, beta }.
	
	The maximum size of the input array is 1,000,000 items.
